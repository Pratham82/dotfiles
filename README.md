# dotfiles

This repo contains the .dotfiles i.e the config files for zsh, vim and hyper. I have curated various extensions over the year and came up with this. Feel free to use them.

I've switched my current programming setup to a linux mahchine and in the process I've decided to ditch VSCode and try VIM(NeoVim) which is a terminal based text editor. I've been hearing lots of good things about so I decided to give it a try and work with at as a daily driver. I'm using other softwares which are must with the VIM setupm I'll list them down below.
